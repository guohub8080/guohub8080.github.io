export default "This JSON contains structured musical data following a hierarchical format: score > parts > sections > phrases > measures > notes. Events are emitted on a single flattened timeline with explicit scopes; process them sequentially (timestamp order) to reconstruct musical flow. Treat all scopes as closed intervals on the timeline (inclusive boundaries): both the start and end nodes/timestamps are inside the scope."
